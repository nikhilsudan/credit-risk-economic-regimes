# Credit Risk Modeling with Economic Regimes

This project develops a regime-aware probability-of-default (PD) model for retail credit portfolios.

The objective is to study how borrower default risk and model sensitivity change across macroeconomic regimes such as economic expansion and contraction.

The project is designed to reflect industry-grade credit risk modeling practices, with emphasis on:
- interpretability
- temporal stability
- regime dependence
- stress testing

Primary techniques include logistic regression, macroeconomic regime definition, and probability stress analysis.
